# Contribution Guide

**English** | [中文](docs/zh/CONTRIBUTING_zh.md)

Thank you for your interest in FranxAgent! We welcome all forms of contributions, including new features, tool plugins, **skills**, documentation improvements, bug reports, and more. To ensure smooth collaboration, please follow the processes and standards below.

---

## 📦 Tool Contribution (Most Common)
If you wish to add a new tool to FranxAgent (such as `weather`, `calc`, etc.), please follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Visit the [FranxAgent Repository](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent) and click **Fork** in the top-right corner to copy the repository to your GitHub account.

### 2. Clone Your Fork Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent.git
cd FranxAgent
```

### 3. Create a New Branch
```bash
git checkout -b add-tool-name
```
Example: `add-weather`.

### 4. Add Tool Files
Create a folder named after the tool on the `tools` branch (e.g., `weather/`).
This folder **must** contain the two files below:

#### a. `tool.py`
- Must include a function named `execute` that accepts keyword arguments and returns a string result.
- Example:
  ```python
  def execute(city: str) -> str:
      # Implement weather query logic
      return f"The weather in {city} is sunny, 25°C"
  ```

#### b. `README.md`
- Briefly describe the tool’s purpose, inputs, outputs, and notes in a clear format (follow the style of existing tools).
- For examples, see `knowledge/tools/time/README.md` on the `main` branch.

### 5. Local Testing
Make sure your tool imports and works properly (you may temporarily modify `src/main.py` for testing).
Run the project:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add [tool name] tool"
```
If others contributed to this tool (e.g., collaborative development), add a `Co-authored-by` tag at the end of the commit message (see "Co-Authors" below).

### 7. Push to Your GitHub Repository
```bash
git push origin add-tool-name
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request
- Open your fork on GitHub and click **Compare & pull request**.
- Write a clear title and description explaining your tool’s functionality, usage examples, etc.
- Click **Create pull request**.

### 9. Wait for Review
Maintainers will review your PR and may suggest changes. You can push further updates to the same branch, and the PR will update automatically.

## 🧠 Skill Contribution
FranxAgent supports loading extra knowledge, rules, or workflows (Markdown files) via the `knowledge/` folder. You can contribute practical skills to help the AI perform better in specific task domains.

### 1. Fork the Repository (Same as Above)

### 2. Clone Your Fork Locally (Same as Above)

### 3. Create a New Branch
```bash
git checkout -b add-skill-name
```
Example: `add-research-workflow`.

### 4. Add Skill Files
Add a `.md` file on the `skills` branch (remember to mark `(Skill)` in the document title).
The file should include:

- **Title** (level-3 heading, e.g., `### Academic Research Workflow`)
- **Overview**: A brief description of the skill’s purpose
- **Disclaimer** (optional): Include a disclaimer if the skill involves domain-specific risks
- **Main Content**: Clear steps, rules, or examples, structured using Markdown heading levels (`##`, `###`, `####`)
- **Usage Suggestions**: Instructions for how the AI or user can utilize this skill
- **License**: Skill files must be released under the **GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) 1.3 or later**. Include a copyright notice at the top of the file in this format:
  ```markdown
  <!--
  Copyright (C) 2026 Author Name
  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
  -->
  ```
  Ensure the repository root includes the GFDL license text (`COPYING` file).

**Requirements**:
- File encoding must be UTF-8.
- Content must be practical, avoid overly vague or duplicated existing knowledge.
- Must not contain any content that violates laws, infringes on others’ rights, or is sensitive.

### 5. Local Verification
Run FranxAgent locally to confirm the skill loads correctly (the console prints a list of loaded skill files on startup).
If the skill content is valid, the AI will exhibit corresponding behavior in conversations.

### 6. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add your-skill-file.md
git commit -m "Add [skill name] skill"
```
For collaborative work, use the `Co-authored-by` tag as needed.

### 7. Push to Your GitHub Repository (Same as Above)

### 8. Create a Pull Request
- Set the target branch to **skills**
- Example title: `Add academic research workflow skill`
- In the description, briefly explain the skill’s purpose, scope, and usage examples.

### 9. Wait for Review
Maintainers will review the skill for logic, formatting, and completeness. Feedback for improvements will be provided in the PR if needed.

## Adding Translations

FranxAgent uses YAML-based i18n. To add a new language:

### 1. Create a YAML file

Copy `i18n/en.yaml` to `i18n/<lang>.yaml` (e.g., `i18n/ja.yaml` for Japanese), then translate all values.

### 2. YAML structure

```yaml
config:
  language: "Sprache"          # Translate the value only
  api_key: "API-Schlüssel"
```

- **Do not** translate keys (`config.language`) — they are code identifiers
- **Do not** translate `{placeholders}` inside values — e.g., `{name}`, `{message}` must stay as-is
- **Do not** translate emoji prefixes — e.g., `📸`, `⏰`, `💾` stay

### 3. Add the language option

In `src/templates/index.html`, add an `<option>` to the language select:

```html
<select id="language">
    <option value="en">English</option>
    <option value="zh">中文</option>
    <option value="ja">日本語</option>  <!-- Add this -->
</select>
```

### 4. Enable the language

Set `"language": "ja"` in `config.json` or select it from the config page.

### 5. Verify

- All UI text should appear in the new language
- Placeholders like `{name}` must render correctly (check tool call blocks, error messages)
- Check the config page, login page, and register page
- If a key is missing, the key itself will be displayed as fallback

### Notes

- Fallback order: `<lang>.yaml` → `en.yaml` → raw key
- If `language` field is missing in `config.json`, defaults to `en`
- Keep translations concise — they share space with UI elements on mobile

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Co-Authors
If you collaborated with partners on development or wish to credit others’ contributions, use this format in your commit message (**must be on its own line; email must be linked to GitHub**):

```bash
git commit -m "Add weather tool

Co-authored-by: Partner Username <partner-email>"
```

GitHub will display both your and your partner’s avatars on the commit.

---

## 📝 Code Style
- Python code follows PEP 8 standards, though strict compliance is not required as long as clarity is maintained.
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables.
- Add necessary comments, especially for complex logic.

---

## 🧪 Testing
- If possible, add simple tests for your tool (a testing framework will be introduced in the future).
- For now, ensure your tool works properly when running `src/main.py` locally.

---

## 🔀 Resolving Conflicts
If your PR has merge conflicts (usually due to branch updates during your submission):
1. Add the official FranxAgent repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent.git
   ```
2. Fetch the latest code:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   ```
3. Merge into your branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout add-tool-name
   git merge upstream/main
   ```
4. Resolve conflicts (Git will indicate conflicting files), then commit and push.

If you are unfamiliar with conflict resolution, leave a comment in the PR and maintainers will assist.
