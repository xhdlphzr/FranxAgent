## [v4.0.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
- **Vector knowledge base**: Unified all knowledge sources (tool descriptions, skill files, MCP tool descriptions, conversation history) and automatically built a local vector database using `sentence-transformers` to enable semantic search.
- **Dynamic system prompt enhancement**: Before each conversation, retrieve the most relevant knowledge fragments based on user input (configurable via `knowledge_k`), dynamically inject them into the system prompt, drastically reducing token consumption while providing precise context to the AI.
- **Conversation history persistence**: Automatically save complete question‑answer pairs to the `skills/memories/` directory; on next startup they are incorporated into the vector knowledge base for cross‑session memory retrieval.
- **Unified tool entry**: Integrated built‑in and MCP tool management into the `skills` module; `agent.py` only needs to import `tool_functions` and `search`, making the code cleaner.
- **Removed `memory.txt` mechanism**: No longer rely on file‑based summaries; use vector search for long‑term memory.
- **Refactored `skills` module**: `skills/__init__.py` now handles tool loading, knowledge collection, vector database construction, and retrieval; the original `tools/` directory moved to `skills/tools/`; MCP server startup logic also migrated here.
- **New configuration `knowledge_k`**: Default value `3`, controlling how many knowledge fragments are retrieved per conversation.
- Fixed an issue where the system prompt was too verbose in multi‑turn conversations; now only the most relevant knowledge is injected.
- Fixed a missing inclusion of MCP tool descriptions in the knowledge base; the AI can now discover available tools through search.
- Removed all `memory.txt`‑related code; that file is no longer generated or read.

## [v4.0.1](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.0.1)
- Renamed the `skills/` directory to `knowledge/` and moved the original `skills/` into `knowledge/skills/`.

## [v4.1.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.1.0)
- Added deep vector search feature: supports recursive retrieval with automatic deduplication, obtaining more relevant knowledge fragments through multiple expansion steps.

## [v4.2.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.2.0)
- After each conversation, the question‑answer pair is immediately vectorized and stored in the knowledge base, taking effect without restart.
- On startup, only newly added, modified, or deleted `.md` files are processed, greatly improving startup speed.
- The `SentenceTransformer` model is now loaded only once and reused for subsequent searches, increasing search speed by 5‑10 times.
- Moved conversation memory backups from `skills/memories/` to `knowledge/memories/` and excluded that directory from automatic scanning; fixed a bug from v4.0.1.
- Removed `session_histories` and the batch‑write logic on exit, simplifying the code.

## [v4.3.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.3.0)
- Full project internationalization: All comments, logs and internal prompts are fully Englishized.

## [v4.4.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.4.0)
- Added type‑based weighting to vector search: tool documents (type='tool') now get full weight 1.0, skills (type='skill') 0.8, and conversation memories (type='conversation') 0.2. This improves retrieval relevance by prioritizing actionable tools over background knowledge and suppressing noisy dialogue history.

## [v4.4.1](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.4.1)
- Reduce redundant memory, fix i18n legacy bugs.

## [v4.5.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.5.0)
- Added hybrid search (vector + FTS5) combining semantic similarity with keyword matching for more accurate knowledge retrieval.
- Added type‑based weighting: tools (1.0) have higher priority than skills (0.8) and conversation memories (0.2).
- Added Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to merge vector and FTS rankings into a single score.
- Automatic document type detection (tool, skill, conversation) during incremental updates.
- Removed length penalty – long documents are no longer suppressed, improving retrieval quality.
- Replaced recursive deep search with breadth‑first single‑shot hybrid retrieval, improving speed and predictability.
- Adjusted document language order: English descriptions moved before Chinese to fit vector model’s token limit; Chinese keywords are still fully indexed by FTS.
- Added FTS query cleaning to remove special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `:`) and prevent syntax errors.
- `knowledge/memories/` directory is now included in incremental update scanning; deleting backup files will remove corresponding vector entries.
- Fixed identical vectors for all tools by removing the copyright comment block from each README, ensuring only meaningful content is vectorised.
- Fixed skill documents dominating search results by adjusting type weights, document language order, and relying on FTS for keyword matching.
- Fixed incremental update ignoring the `memories/` directory by including it in file state collection.

## [v4.6.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.6.0)
- New animation system **Breath of Motion**: Introduces liquid glass bottom dock, page sliding transitions, AI reply breathing dot, and smooth expand/collapse animations for the console and knowledge panel.
- Added RSA password authentication: Automatically generates a key pair on first run, encrypts password with public key on the frontend, decrypts with private key on the backend, enhancing login security.
- Added JWT session management: Issues short-lived tokens (default 1 hour) after login, supports "refresh-to-re-login" mode (token stored only in memory, cleared on page refresh).
- Integrated Cloudflare Tunnel: One‑click temporary tunnel to generate a publicly accessible URL, enabling remote access without a public IP.
- Full mobile adaptation: Replaces sidebar with bottom dock, optimizes message bubbles and input area for touchscreens, supports phones and tablets.
- Knowledge panel refactoring: Collapsible panel that displays retrieved knowledge, each item can be independently expanded to view full text, uses tech‑blue color scheme, scroll support for long documents.
- Console no longer auto‑opens: User must click to open, avoiding interruption of the chat experience.
- Added empty‑text check when inserting conversation memory into the vector database in real time, preventing invalid records from polluting search results.

## [v4.6.1](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.6.1)
- Fixed the issue in `agent.py` where multi‑turn conversation history was being reset; consecutive `input` calls on the same `FranxAgent` instance now correctly retain context.  
- Optimized system prompt delivery: `USER_GUIDE` is sent only once at the beginning of the session, no longer repeated in every turn, significantly reducing token usage.  
- Dynamically retrieved knowledge is now injected as a temporary system message without polluting the persistent conversation history.  
- Fixed message synchronization in the tool‑calling loop, ensuring tool results are correctly appended to the history.  
- Additional minor improvements and code comment updates.

## [v4.6.2](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.6.2)
- Change `USER_GUIDE` in `agent.py`.

## [v4.6.3](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.6.3)

## [v4.7.0](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.7.0)
- Removed the `base_url` field for the `ett` tool from `config.json` as it is no longer needed.  
- Improved user experience: automatically copy `config.example.json` and rename it to `config.json` on startup, so users don’t need to do it manually.  
- Added a click‑to‑confirm disclaimer checkbox that users must check before continuing to use.
- Added shake animation.

## [v4.7.1](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAgent/releases/tag/v4.7.1)

- Major refactoring: split `src/app.py` into `state.py`, `auth.py`, `scheduler.py`, and `routes/` directory (`auth.py`, `chat.py`, `config.py`, `tasks.py`) — each file maps to a clear domain.
- Major refactoring: extracted CSS into `static/css/index.css`, `login.css`, `register.css`.
- Major refactoring: extracted JS into `static/js/` — `i18n.js`, `auth.js`, `chat.js`, `config.js`, `app.js`, `login.js`, `register.js`.
