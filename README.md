# FranxAI 🤖

**Let AI work like a partner – simple, safe, low cost.**

FranxAI is a lightweight AI agent framework that enables AI to read files, execute commands, search the web, understand multimodal content, and truly control the world through the MCP protocol. **Now it also features an "Echo of Thought" vector knowledge base: all tool descriptions, skill files, and even conversation history are automatically vectorized and persistently stored. For every query, the AI uses **hybrid retrieval (vector semantics + keyword matching)** to precisely locate the most relevant knowledge fragments and inject them into the system prompt, enabling long-term memory, cross-session recall, and dynamic knowledge enhancement. From "Words to Worlds", now let every echo nourish thought.**

## ✨ Core Features

- 🛠️ **Rich built‑in tools**: `time`, `read`, `write`, `command`, `search`, `similarity`, `ett` (multimodal understanding), `beijing_subway` (Beijing subway route planning), etc. Easily extensible.
- 🌐 **MCP protocol support**: Integrate any stdio‑based MCP server with simple configuration (command + args). The AI automatically learns to use all its tools.
- 🧠 **Intelligent memory**: Automatically compresses conversation history and stores complete dialogues into `knowledge/memories/`, which are reloaded on next startup for cross‑session knowledge retrieval.
- ⏰ **Scheduled tasks**: Background thread runs daily repeated tasks; the AI executes instructions at specified times.
- 📚 **Skill system**: All Markdown files under `knowledge/` are automatically merged into the system prompt, injecting domain knowledge, rules, or workflows.
- 🔒 **Safety first**: The `command` tool prohibits direct file deletion; suggests moving instead. High‑risk operations can be configured for approval.
- 🕸️ **Free web search**: Built‑in DuckDuckGo search – no API key required.
- 📊 **Text similarity**: Rolling‑hash based similarity calculation for strings.
- 🖼️ **Multimodal understanding**: Supports images, videos, documents (Word, Excel, PDF). The AI truly sees the world.
- ⚙️ **Minimal configuration**: Single `config.json` for API key, model, system prompt.
- 📦 **Lightweight dependencies**: Only Python standard library + `openai` SDK (compatible with local Ollama and various cloud APIs).
- 💻 **Cross‑platform**: Path handling via `pathlib` works on Windows, Linux, macOS.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAI.git
cd FranxAI
```

### 2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
Windows users: double‑click `start.bat`; macOS users: double‑click `start.sh`.

### 3. Configuration
Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit.

Available fields in `config.json`:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `api_key` | string | - | API key (required). For Ollama, any value works. |
| `base_url` | string | - | API base URL (required). e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1` for Ollama, `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4` for GLM. |
| `model` | string | - | Model name (required). Recommended: `glm-4.7-flash`, `qwen2.5:7b`. |
| `settings` | string | `"You are a helpful AI assistant. 你是一个有用的AI助手。"` | System prompt to set AI role/behavior. |
| `temperature` | float | `0.8` | Randomness (0‑1). Lower = more deterministic. |
| `thinking` | bool | `false` | Enable deep‑thinking mode (GLM only). Slower but outputs reasoning. |
| `max_iterations` | int | `100` | Max tool call iterations to prevent infinite loops. |
| `threshold` | int | `20` | When message count exceeds this, compress the earliest 10 into a summary. |
| `knowledge_k` | int | `5` | Number of knowledge fragments retrieved per conversation. Larger values inject more context but consume more tokens. |
| `mcp_servers` | list | `[]` | MCP server configurations, each with `name`, `command`, `args` (optional). Example: `[{"name": "windows-mcp", "command": "uvx", "args": ["windows-mcp"]}]`. |

**Independent ETT (multimodal) configuration (optional)**  
You can specify separate parameters for `ett` under the `tools` field:

```json
{
    "tools": {
        "ett": {
            "api_key": "your-ett-api-key",
            "base_url": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4",
            "model": "glm-4.6v-flash",
            "temperature": 0.8,
            "thinking": false,
            "max_retries": 5
        }
    }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Note**: The `ett` tool currently only supports Zhipu GLM series models (e.g. `glm-4.6v-flash`). Make sure to configure the correct API key and model.

**Example configuration (Zhipu GLM + Windows‑MCP)**:
```json
{
    "api_key": "your-zhipu-api-key",
    "base_url": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4",
    "model": "glm-4.7-flash",
    "temperature": 0.8,
    "thinking": false,
    "max_iterations": 100,
    "threshold": 20,
    "knowledge_k": 5,
    "settings": "You are a helpful AI assistant. 你是一个有用的AI助手。",
    "tools": {
        "ett": {
            "api_key": "your-zhipu-api-key",
            "base_url": "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4",
            "model": "glm-4.6v-flash",
            "temperature": 0.8,
            "thinking": false,
            "max_iterations": 100,
            "max_retries": 20
        }
    },
    "mcp_servers": [
        {
            "name": "windows-mcp",
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["windows-mcp"]
        }
    ]
}
```

> 💡 **Tip**: After saving configuration changes, they take effect in the next conversation – no need to restart.

> 💡 **Model recommendation**: Use `glm-4.7-flash` for conversation and `glm-4.6v-flash` for vision tasks.

### 4. Run
Windows: double‑click `run.bat`; macOS: double‑click `run.sh`. Press `Ctrl+C` to exit.

Ask a question, and the AI will use tools to help you.

## 🛠️ Tool Descriptions

| Tool | Purpose | Security / Notes |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `time` | Current date/time | Read‑only, safe |
| `read` | Read file content | Read‑only |
| `write` | Write/append to file | Auto‑creates parent directories; overwrite/append options |
| `command` | Execute system command | ❌ Direct deletion blocked; suggests moving instead. Supports timeout. |
| `search` | Web search (DuckDuckGo) | Free, no API key. Returns title, snippet, URL. |
| `similarity` | String similarity (rolling hash) | Window size 3 bytes, returns percentage. |
| `add_task` | Add scheduled task | Parameters: `content`, `time` (HH:MM) |
| `del_task` | Delete scheduled task | Delete by ID, auto‑renumber remaining tasks |
| `ett` | Multimodal understanding | Analyze images, videos, documents (Word/Excel/PDF). Requires Zhipu GLM‑4.6V‑Flash. Supports public URL or local file (auto base64). |
| `beijing_subway` | Beijing subway route planning | Input start and end station names, returns optimal route (peak/off‑peak speed considered). Requires `station.json` and `graph.txt` in `knowledge/tools/beijing_subway/` and `geopy` installed. |

**MCP tool integration**  
Add any MCP server (stdio mode) in `config.json`:
```json
{
    "mcp_servers": [
        {
            "name": "windows-mcp",
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["windows-mcp"]
        }
    ]
}
```
After startup, the AI automatically discovers all tools from these servers and calls them via the unified `tools` tool. No extra configuration – just say “take a screenshot”.

**Remote hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi)**  
To control remote hardware via SSH, add a configuration like:
```json
{
  "mcp_servers": [
    {
      "name": "raspberry-gpio",
      "command": "ssh",
      "args": ["-T", "pi@raspberry-ip", "python", "/home/pi/raspberry_mcp.py"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes**:
- All tools (built‑in + MCP) are called via the single `tools` tool, saving tokens.
- Built‑in tool names are fixed (e.g., `read`, `write`). MCP tools use `server/tool` format (e.g., `windows-mcp/snapshot`).
- `command` has built‑in safety; deleting requires moving.
- `similarity` helps with deduplication and checking.
- Scheduled tasks run in background, daily repetition, no persistent user online required.
- `ett` only supports Zhipu GLM models; ensure correct `tools.ett` configuration.

## 🧠 Skill System

FranxAI loads Markdown files from `knowledge/skills/` and merges them into the system prompt. You can write `.md` files to inject domain knowledge, behavior rules, workflows, etc., customizing the AI's behavior.

**Usage**:
1. Create `skills/` under `knowledge/` if not exists.
2. Place your Markdown files there (e.g., `coding_style.md`, `company_rules.md`). You can copy some skills from the [skills branch](https://github.com/xhdlphzr/FranxAI/tree/skills) (note: these skills undergo some review, but FranxAI is not responsible for their content).
3. Start FranxAI – all `.md` files are automatically read and stored into the database, ready for retrieval.

**Example**:
Suppose `skills/coding_style.md` contains:
> Code style: Use 4‑space indentation, snake_case for variables, camelCase for functions.

The AI will then follow these style conventions in subsequent conversations.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Skill files are provided by users; FranxAI assumes no responsibility for their content. Ensure the content complies with laws and does not contain sensitive or harmful information.

## 🧠 Memory & Scheduled Tasks

- **Long‑term memory**: FranxAI no longer relies on `memory.txt`. Complete conversation history is automatically saved to `knowledge/memories/` (one `.md` file per session). On next startup, these histories are loaded into the vector knowledge base, allowing the AI to recall previous conversations via **hybrid retrieval (vector semantics + keyword matching)**.
- **History compression**: When messages exceed `threshold`, the first half is compressed into a summary to keep context within limits.
- **Scheduled tasks**: Background thread checks `tasks.json` every 10 seconds; executes commands at specified times (HH:MM). Supports daily repetition without duplication.
